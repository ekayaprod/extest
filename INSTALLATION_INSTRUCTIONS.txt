TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you get an error about icons:

Make sure you have icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png in the same folder.

The icons can be any simple PNG images.

If the extension doesn't appear:

Check that all files are in the same folder.

Ensure manifest.json is named exactly that (not manifest.json.txt).

Try refreshing the extensions page.

NEXT STEPS:

If it works:

Report back that extensions are allowed. We can then proceed with converting the full CA IM Form Filler tool to a more powerful and user-friendly extension.

If it doesn't work:

This indicates your environment blocks local extension installation. We will stick with the bookmarklet approach instead.
